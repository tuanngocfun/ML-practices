# Exercises for 3D Computer Vision

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Installation

### Unix

For the installation I recommend a python venv.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tuanngocfun/ML-practices.git
cd 3dcv/
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows

Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
Make sure that the installer adds Python to your PATH.

In PowerShell run

```bat
git clone https://github.com/tuanngocfun/ML-practices.git
```

(if you don't use git, just download and extract the zip file)

```bat
cd .\3dcv\
pip install torch torchvision -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

## Usage

In order to edit the notebooks run

```sh
jupyter-lab
```

to start the local webserver.
If the notebook home page does not show up immediately, open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser.
Now, just open one of the task notebooks and start editing.
