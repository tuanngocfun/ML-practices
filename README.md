# Merchant Rating System

## Overview

An e-commerce organization aims to enhance customer experience by implementing a merchant rating system. This system will help customers decide which merchant provides better services by analyzing transaction and merchant data. As a Big Data Expert, your task is to develop this rating system.

## Datasets

### Dataset 1: Transaction Dataset

This dataset contains detailed information about transactions, including:

- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction
- **Merchant ID**: Unique identifier for each merchant
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Transaction Date**: Date and time of the transaction
- **Transaction Amount**: The amount spent in the transaction
- **Transaction Rating**: Customer rating for the transaction

### Dataset 2: Merchant Data

This dataset contains information about the merchants, including:

- **Merchant ID**: Unique identifier for each merchant
- **Merchant Name**: Name of the merchant
- **Merchant Category**: Category of products/services provided by the merchant
- **Merchant Location**: Physical or online location of the merchant

## Objectives

1. **Data Integration**: Merge transaction data with merchant data to create a unified dataset for analysis.
2. **Merchant Rating Calculation**: Develop an algorithm to calculate the average rating for each merchant based on transaction ratings.
3. **Service Quality Analysis**: Analyze transaction patterns and customer feedback to determine the quality of services provided by merchants.
4. **Recommendation System**: Create a system to recommend top-rated merchants to customers based on their transaction history and preferences.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess both datasets to ensure data quality and consistency.
2. **Data Integration**: Join transaction data with merchant data using the `Merchant ID` as the key.
3. **Rating Calculation**: Compute average ratings for each merchant and analyze trends.
4. **Service Quality Analysis**: Use statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze service quality and identify key factors influencing customer satisfaction.
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Implement a recommendation algorithm to suggest the best merchants to customers.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Big Data Platforms**: Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
- **Data Storage**: HDFS, Apache Hive
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Java
- **Machine Learning**: Weka, Deeplearning4j
